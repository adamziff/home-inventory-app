      1. Use the /app directory and the new app router.
      2. Avoid the old /pages directory in new code.
      3. Favor server components for logic, and client components only if needed (e.g., user interaction).
      4. Use TypeScript with strict mode on for better type safety and error detection.
      5. Maintain good SEO with Next.js 15's built-in metadata configurations.
examples:
  - input: "A new file in /pages or referencing outdated next/router approaches"
    output: "Migrate to the new /app router. Use server components and Next.js 15 conventions."
